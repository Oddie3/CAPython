''' Creating a function

Let’s start by defining a function called calculate_insurance_cost() on line 2. For now, your function should not have any parameters or output.

Let’s outline the behavior we want our function to have. Inside of calculate_insurance_cost(), do the following:

Create a variable called estimated_cost. For now, set this variable equal to a value of 1000. You’ll add the full formula in the next step.
Add a print statement that prints estimated_cost. You should output a message similar to: "The estimated insurance cost for this person is xxx dollars."
Return estimated_cost
Adding parameters to a function

Nice job – you’ve created a simple Python function that we’ll use to estimate medical insurance costs.

However, the function currently returns a value of 1000. We want it to return our insurance cost formula instead.

Now that we have set up the function to take inputs for each of the values needed in the insurance formula, we can make use of them inside of our function.

The function is now properly set up to calculate an individual’s medical insurance costs based on the five variables passed into it. Let’s test this out!

Go to the section of code that estimates Maria’s insurance cost.

Rename insurance_cost as maria_insurance_cost and set it equal to calculate_insurance_cost() with the appropriate values for Maria as arguments.


Now, remove the print statement for Maria since our function will take care of printing the estimated cost for us.

Additionally, remove the five lines of code defining the initial variables for Maria, as we are now passing in these values directly in the function call.


Repeat steps 6-7 for Omar:

Rename insurance_cost as omar_insurance_cost and set it equal to the calculate_insurance_cost() function, passing in the appropriate values as arguments.
Remove the initial variables and print statement for Omar.
Notice how much cleaner our code is now! By utilizing a Python function, we were able to condense many lines of code into just a few.

Adding new parameters

Click “Save” to see the estimated insurance costs for Maria and Omar as calculated by your function.

In the output terminal, notice that it says "The estimated insurance cost for this person is..." but it does not specify the actual name of the person.

To fix this, begin by adding an additional parameter called name to the function definition.


Next, modify the print statement in the function so that it includes the new name parameter, replacing "this person" with the actual name of the person.


We must also update our function calls, passing in the name variable as an argument.

Update the function call for maria_insurance_cost, passing in name = "Maria" as an argument.

Do the same for Omar, passing in name = "Omar".

Now if you click “Save”, you’ll see that our function is able to write a more personalized message specifying the name of the individual it is estimating insurance costs for. Pretty neat, right?

Estimating your own insurance cost

In this example, we calculated the insurance costs for two individuals, but with our new code we can easily extend this to thousands or even millions of individuals.

To illustrate, estimate your own insurance cost.

At the bottom of your code, create a new insurance_cost variable for yourself, similar to how we did it for Maria and Omar.

Set the variable equal to a function call to calculate_insurance_cost(), passing in your own name, age, sex, bmi, number of children, and smoker status.

Click “Save” to see the result. '''

# Create calculate_insurance_cost() function below: 
def calculate_insurance_cost(age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker, name):
    estimated_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
    print("The estimated insurance cost for " + name + " is " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
    return estimated_cost

# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age = 28, sex = 0, bmi = 26.2, num_of_children = 3, smoker = 0, name = "Maria")

# Estimate Omar's insurance cost 
omar_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age = 35, sex = 1, bmi = 22.2, num_of_children = 0, smoker = 1, name = "Omar")

o_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(age = 26, sex = 1, bmi = 30, num_of_children = 0, smoker = 1, name = "O")
